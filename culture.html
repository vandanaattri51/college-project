     <h1>Haryana culture</h1>
     <p>Haryana's culture is reflective of its folklore. Submerged in the rich cultural heritage of the Vedic Period, the mystical state of Haryana stands out from the crowd. The rich Haryanvi culture is characterised by the hookahs and the charpoys, the vivid fairs and the swaying paddy fields; Haryana is one of the wealthiest states in India and is one of the most economically developed regions in South Asia. Popularly known as 'The Home of Gods', this vibrant state has a bountiful culture, heritage, festivals, folklores and a vibrant landscape.</p>
     <h2>Haryanvi Language</h2>
     <p>With Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, and English forming the main languages, there are numerous dialects that are spoken in Haryana. However, almost all of them have their base in Hindi. Sanskrit is also taught in most of the schools in Haryana. In towns and cities, English is still to be adopted as the household lingo but is spoken in a hazy mixture of Hindi.

        The most striking feature of Haryana is its language itself; or rather, the manner in which it is spoken. Popularly known as Haryanvi, Bangaru, or Jatu, it is perhaps a bit crude but full of earthy humor and straightforwardness. With rapid urbanization, and due to Haryana’s close proximity to Delhi, the cultural aspects are now taking a more modern hue.</p>
     <h2>Haryana Customes</h2>
     <p>Women love to wear colorful dresses. Their basic trousseau includes ‘Damaan’, ‘Kurti’ & ‘Chunder’. ‘Chunder’ is the long, colored piece of cloth, decorated with shiny laces, meant to cover the head and is drawn in the front like the ‘pallav’ of the saree. Kurti is a shirt like a blouse, usually white in color. The ‘Daaman’ is the flairy ankle-long skirt, in striking colors.

        The men generally wear ‘Dhoti’, the wrap-around cloth, tucked in between the legs with a white-colored kurta worn atop it. ‘Pagri’ is the traditional headgear for men, which is now worn mainly by the old villagers. All-white attire is a status symbol for men.</p>
